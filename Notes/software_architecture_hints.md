# Software Architecture Hints

- Whenever we introduce an architectural pattern in this book, we’ll always ask, "What do we get for this? And what does it cost us?". Usually, at the very least, we’ll be introducing an extra layer of abstraction, and although we may hope it will reduce complexity overall, it does add complexity locally, and it has a cost in terms of the raw numbers of moving parts and ongoing maintenance.
